## Introduction
The bias we are studying comes from differential retrieval. That is, if items pertaining to a given group are less likely to show up in the “top” of a Best Match sorted set, that means that users are less likely to see information pertaining to that group. We will compare results sets returned by Best Match and most recent sorting methods, and compare the items returned for markers of “aboutness” for a given group.
